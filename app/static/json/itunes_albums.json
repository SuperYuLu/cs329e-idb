American Teen is all about summer sunshine, young love, and the adventures of tight-knit friends\u2014subjects perfectly matched with the elegant blend of throwback R&B, \u201880s pop, and glitchy future-soul. The best tunes, openhearted ballads like \u201cSaved\u201d and \u201cShot Down,\u201d are earnest without being overwrought and easily establish the songwriter as one of 2017\u2019s most impressive newcomers.", "artist": "Khalid", "genre": "R&B/Soul", "num_of_songs": "15", "track": [["1", "American Teen", "4:10"], ["2", "Young Dumb & Broke", "3:22"], ["3", "Location", "3:39"], ["4", "Another Sad Love Song", "4:04"], ["5", "Saved", "3:26"], ["6", "Coaster", "3:19"], ["7", "8TEEN", "3:48"], ["8", "Let's Go", "3:24"], ["9", "Hopeless", "2:47"], ["10", "Cold Blooded", "3:27"], ["11", "Winter", "4:01"], ["12", "Therapy", "4:17"], ["13", "Keep Me", "4:36"], ["14", "Shot Down", "3:27"], ["15", "Angels", "2:50"]]},

Guitarist Jimmy Page always had a deep interest in English folk music and while his reputation as one of rock\u2019s most formidable electric lead guitar players was firmly established, he was also no slouch with the acoustic. The album opens on an anthemic note with the Nordic trample of \u201cThe Immigrant Song\u201d and \u201cCelebration Day\u201d leading the heavy metal brigade. However, from the traditional \u201cGallows Pole\u201d through the excited grace of \u201cBron-Y-Aur Stomp\u201d and the genuine pastoral countryside shadings of \u201cTangerine\u201d and \u201c\u201dThat\u2019s the Way,\u201d Led Zeppelin nearly sound like a jam band. But the core of the group, Page and former \u201860s session extraordinaire John Paul Jones, perform with a deliberate mastery that captures the magic of the performance with the precision that can only be crafted in a carefully controlled studio. The group can veer near chaos (\u201cOut On the Tiles\u201d) and pull it back at just the right moment. Even in their quietest moments, their sense of tension leads them into further dimensions.", "artist": "Led Zeppelin", "genre": "Rock", "num_of_songs": "10", "track": [["1", "Immigrant Song", "2:26"], ["2", "Friends", "3:53"], ["3", "Celebration Day", "3:30"], ["4", "Since I've Been Loving You", "7:24"], ["5", "Out On the Tiles", "4:07"], ["6", "Gallows Pole", "4:57"], ["7", "Tangerine", "3:11"], ["8", "That's the Way", "5:37"], ["9", "Bron-Y-Aur Stomp", "4:17"], ["10", "Hats Off to (Roy) Harper", "3:42"]]},
